# TicTacToe
Hello! My name is Andrey, I'm 16 and this is my first project!

The game has main screen with main menu on top and game field on the middle. At the bottom of the main page is info about game and current settings.

### Main menu

+ Button __"START"__ starts a new match that continues until the end situation or until any outer page is opened (options or titres)

+ Button __"OPTIONS"__ opens an option menu where you can change difficulty, your sign and who's is the first turn.

+ Button __"GET A HINT"__ is active only during the match and shows the best move if you have at least 1 hint.

+ Button __"ABOUT GAME"__ opens short article about me.

Hope you'll enjoy the game :)
