# TicTacToe

__Tic-Tac-Toe__ game application on C++ that implements [__Minimax__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax "Minimax Wikipedia") algorithm. It is written according to a procedural programming paradigm. IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

### A few words about...

You can choose from three difficulties: 

+ __Easy:__ randomly chooses the move
+ __Mid:__ randomly chooses between __Easy__-mode and __Hard__-mode
+ __Hard__: always takes the best avaliable move ([__Minimax__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax "Minimax Wikipedia") algorithm)

Also you can change your sign and choose whose is the first turn. And you can get a hint (the best avaliable move) if you need.
